# Diabetes Prediction ML

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and handling class imbalance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of medical predictor variables and a target variable (Outcome), indicating diabetes presence. Features include pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, etc.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the entire pipeline.

## Model Evaluation
- The model is evaluated on training, validation, and test sets using accuracy and binary crossentropy loss.
- Training history is available for analysis.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
